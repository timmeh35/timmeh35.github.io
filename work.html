            <p>I started working here in 2020. It's my second job, my first job was assistant reffing soccer games, and
                I've enjoyed every second of it. I have befriended the entire working staff and ave gotten close with
                all the managers and even some customers. There will be times where I miss work and some of the customer
                will question where I'm at because they're used to seeing me certain days. I work to satisfy customers
                and prepare their meals, while maintaining the work environment by cleaning up my station and getting
                along with my coworkers.</p>

            <p>I began working here May of 2023. It's my third job and my current second part time job, I work at my
                Highschool and repair chromebooks when needed. I sit at my desk and have students come to me and hand me
                chromebooks that need repaired and I do my best to fix the issue, if it's something a bit more
                complicated I'll send it to my supervisor who has been working here many years. The 9/10 the problem
                will be a broken chromebook screen, but sometimes there's a serous issue, either software like
                networking, or hardware like a defective battery.</p>
