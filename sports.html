            <h2>Favorite Sport</h2>
            <p>Soccer is for sure my favorite sport that I've played. I played it for the most time, played throughout
                my childhood wiht my bestfriends, and finished my Highschool season in a great way. My senior season of
                soccer we made it all the way to district finals for the first time in 14 years. This was a huge feat
                and I wa glad we could do it before I hung up the boots, nothing will ever compare to the feeling of joy
                and commitment I had to this team and I'll miss them all dearly.</p>
