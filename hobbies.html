        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Because of my jampacked schedule of athletics and work I don't usually have much free time. But when I do I like to do these things: Video gaming, fishing, hanging out with my partner or friends, resting, watching movies. My favorite videogames are Minecraft and Fortnite. I've caught plenty of fish in my life, I primarily fish for Bass. I am holding down a relationship with a nice girl who I respect dearly and I like to spend my time with her at her house socializing with her and her parents. I've made plenty of friends throughout my life and during sports, we like to stay up late at night and play random games and go for midnight walks. Because I'm always working or at soccer practice I like to rest when I can so anytime I don't have plans and if I'm feeling tired enough I could rest for hours. Some of my favorite movies include the marvel series, and holidday movies like Christmas Vacation.</p>
